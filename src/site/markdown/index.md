# Maven plugin, Spring Boot Test autoconfiguration and jUnit Extension for IntelliJ HTTP Client

I had started with a Maven plugin to run HTTP requests on the <em>integration-test</em> phase
using the [IntelliJ HTTP Client][http-client]. Later I added a Spring Boot Test autoconfiguration,
thanks [@GoncaloPT][GoncaloPT] for [his idea][leverage-test]. Next step was jUnit Extension.

## Getting started

Originally the IntelliJ HTTP Client plugin allows to create, edit, and execute HTTP requests
directly in the IntelliJ IDEA code editor.
The IntelliJ HTTP Client is also [available as a CLI tool][cli-tool].

The Maven plugin and jUnit Extension allows to run HTTP requests on the <em>integration-test</em> phase
using the IntelliJ HTTP Client. The Spring Boot Test autoconfiguration allows to run them with
Spring Boot Test, you don't need to package and run whole application.

The [HTTP Request in Editor Specification][specification]
describes format these files.

Example requests:

```http
GET /api/get HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Host: example.com

### Add an item
POST /api/add HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "entity",
  "value": "content"
}
```

### Directories (extra feature)

**IntelliJ HTTP Client** needs HTTP files to work.
With **HTTP Client Command Line** you can set directories that contain such files.
